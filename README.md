# HAVEN

## Description 
------------------------------------------------------------------
First ever hackhathon that I joined with two of my friends. This hackhathon requires the particpants to build a website based on one of the United Nation Sustainable Development goals. The goal that was chosen by us was Sustainable Cities and Communities. 

The aim of our website is 1) to create a centralized website for citizens to join any volunteering activities without having to spend much time and effort in searching and 2) to assist organizations in achieving targeted number of volunteers.
